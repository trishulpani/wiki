# Challenge Shopping List

:triangular_flag_on_post: Remember to use [**`Read-Search-Ask`**](FreeCodeCamp-Get-Help) if you get stuck. Try to pair program :busts_in_silhouette: and write your own code :pencil:

### :checkered_flag: Problem Explanation:

Create a shopping list in the variable **myList**. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e. `["Chocolate Bar", 15]`.

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

- **myList** should be an array.
- The first elements in each of your sub-arrays must all be strings.
- The second elements in each of your sub-arrays must all be numbers.
- You must have at least 5 items in your list.

## :speech_balloon: Hint: 1

A multi-dimensional array would have the following outline `[[]]`.

## :speech_balloon: Hint: 2

Each sub-array should be separated by `,` as would any item in an array.

## :speech_balloon: Hint: 3

Don't forget the `;` at the end of your declaration.

**Solution ahead!**

## :beginner: Basic Code Solution:

```javascript
var myList = [["Canned Beans", 3],["Milk Galon", 1],["Cereal", 2],["Toilet Paper", 12],["Sack of Rice", 1]];
```

### Code Explanation:

- A multi-dimensional array is created.
- The array consists five arrays inside, each composed of a string and an integer, in the same order.
