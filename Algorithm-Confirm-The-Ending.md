# Algorithm Confirm the Ending

![](https://i.imgur.com/Z7vhddH.jpg)

### :checkered_flag: Problem Explanation:

The function is a whole Boolean operation. You need to return true if the first argument ends with the second argument. This means that for the problem script, it should return true for the `confirmEnding('Bastian', 'n');` case.

## :speech_balloon: Hint: 1

Take a look at how substr() works. You will be trying to get the last Nth characters.

## :speech_balloon: Hint: 2

To get the Nth-to-Last character you will use length() and turn it into a negative number.

## :speech_balloon: Hint: 3

Check that you have the proper syntax and that you use `===` to compare.

**Solution ahead!**

## :beginner: Basic Code Solution:

```javascript
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  return str.substr(-target.length) === target;
}
```

### Code Explanation:
The `substr()` method returns the characters in a string beginning at the specified location through the optional specified number of characters. `substr` operates through the end of the string if the second optional parameter is not specified. `substr()` calculates the index of first matching character from the string's end if the specified location is negative. Using the `-` operator in front of `target.length` makes it negative.

We use the method `substr()` with the negative value of `target`'s length to extract the ending segment of `str` of the same size as `target`, compare it to `target`, and then return the value of this boolean expression.
