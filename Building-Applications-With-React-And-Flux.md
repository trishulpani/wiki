# Building applications with React and Flux

This is designed to run in a c9 environment.

Once installed, enter `npm install` into the bash terminal. Then type `gulp` from the bash terminal.

Your React development environment is now ready.

The environment will compile React JSX, Lint JSX and JS with ESlint, Bundle your JS and CSS files, Migrate the built app to the dist folder, and run a dev web-server.
