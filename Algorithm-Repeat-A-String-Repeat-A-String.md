# Algorithm Repeat a String

:triangular_flag_on_post: Remember to use [**`Read-Search-Ask`**](FreeCodeCamp-Get-Help) if you get stuck. Try to pair program :busts_in_silhouette: and write your own code :pencil:

### :checkered_flag: Problem Explanation:

The program is very simple, we have to take a variable and return that variable being repeated certain amount of times. No need to add space or anything, just keep repeating it into one single string.

## :speech_balloon: Hint: 1

You can't edit strings, you will need to create a variable to store the new string.

## :speech_balloon: Hint: 2

Create a loop to repeat the code as many times as needed.

## :speech_balloon: Hint: 3

Make the variable created store the current value and append the word to it.

**Solution ahead!**

## :beginner: Basic Code Solution:

```javascript
function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
  var accumulatedStr = '';

  while (num > 0) {
    accumulatedStr += str;
    num--;
  }

  return accumulatedStr;
}
```

### Code Explanation:
- Create an empty string variable to store the repeated word.
- Use a while loop or for loop to repeat code as many times as needed according to `num`
- Then we just have to add the string to the variable created on step one, and increase or decrease `num` depending on how you set the loop.
- At the end of the loop, return the variable for the repeated word.

## :sunflower: Intermediate Code Solution:

```javascript
function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
  if(num < 0)
    return "";
  if(num === 1)
    return str;
  else
    return str + repeatStringNumTimes(str, num - 1);
}
```

### Code Explanation:
- This solution uses recursion.
- We check if `num` is negative and return an empty string if true.
- Then we check if it's equal to 1 and in that case we return the string itself.
- If not, we add the string to a call of our function with `num` being decreased by 1, which will add another `str` and another.. until eventually `num` is 1. And return that whole process.

## :rotating_light: Advanced Code Solution:

```javascript
function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
  return num >= 0 ? str.repeatStringNumTimes(num) : "";
}

repeatStringNumTimes("abc", 3);
```

### Code Explanation:
- This solution takes a declarative approach.
- It is similar to the third solution, except it uses the ternary operator form of the `if` statement.
